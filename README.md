# Drift Monitoring & Feature Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks for monitoring **data drift**, **feature drift**, and **distribution shifts** in clinical datasets. The analysis explores correlations between drift metrics and model performance (AUROC), leveraging PCA/TF-IDF methods.

## üìÇ Contents

- **baseline_training.ipynb**  
  Trains baseline models for drift monitoring.

- **combined_plot.ipynb**  
  Generates combined visualization plots for multiple drift metrics.

- **Correlation Analysis - Distribution Drift vs Model AUROC.ipynb**  
  Explores the relationship between drift signals and model AUROC performance.

- **drift_visual_v3_training_strategy_feature_investigation.ipynb**  
  Detailed feature-level drift visualization and training strategy experiments.

- **read_data_test.ipynb**  
  Utility notebook for reading and testing datasets.

- **s3_files_download.ipynb**  
  Script for downloading raw data from AWS S3.

- **tfidf_pca.ipynb**  
  Implements TF-IDF with PCA for dimensionality reduction and drift tracking.

## üìä Project Context

These notebooks were developed as part of a clinical data science project to evaluate **model robustness under distribution shifts**. Methods include:
- Outlier detection
- Drift monitoring with KS/JS divergence
- PCA-based dimensionality reduction
- Correlation of drift metrics with AUROC
